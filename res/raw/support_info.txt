NOTE: Before Using Maps Offline
----------------

This app is designed to download all maps for offline use when it is first installed. To use the offline maps:
• Make sure you see "Offline maps are available" under the Settings tab
• If not, use the download button to download the maps
• Open at least *one* map while online (just once) so the underlying Google Maps framework can verify a license.
• After that, maps should work wherever you go - with our without a data connection, and with no further downloads!

If you want to view Google Maps layers instead of our offline maps, however, you'll need a data connection.
