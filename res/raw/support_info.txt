We hope we've found all issues with the app during our development and
testing! However, it's likely there are things we didn't find, things
we could have made easier, or things you'd like to see added to a future
version of the app. You may submit your questions to our Facebook page
or our Google+ community for discussion with other users. Or, you may
email us directly:
